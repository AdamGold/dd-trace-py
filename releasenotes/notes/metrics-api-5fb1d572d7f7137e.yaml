upgrade:
  - |
    The ``collect_metrics`` argument of the ``tracer.configure`` method has been
    removed. Runtime metrics are now enabled only via the
    ``DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED`` environment variable.
other:
  - |
    Remove references to runtime metrics from the Tracer object and into its own
    API, similarly to what is done for the profiling service.
